The program mini will take as an argument a single HTML file that has been
downloaded from http://www.cs.txstate.edu/accounts/faculty. It will create a
file called "info.txt" that will have the professor's name, research interests,
education, office location, and webpage address. The information is extracted
from the html files using regular expressions through the programs grep and
sed.

Example Run:
	./mini.sh byron-gao.html
